# Big-Sales-Prediction

## 1. Introduction
The "Big Sales Prediction" project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict sales figures based on various features such as item characteristics, store attributes, and historical sales data. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, this project provides insights into sales trends and helps in making data-driven business decisions.

## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Dataset Inspection: The dataset was loaded and examined for missing values, data types, and feature distributions.

Handling Missing Data: Appropriate imputation techniques were applied to fill missing values in relevant columns.

Data Transformation: Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical features were scaled as necessary.

## 3. Model Selection and Training
For this project I chose Random Forest Regression for its high accuracy and ability to handle non-linear relationship in data

## 4. Model Evaluation
Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) were used to compare models.

## 5. Results and Insights
The selected model achieved a strong predictive performance, reducing error margins significantly.
Key factors influencing sales included item visibility, item type, and store attributes.
The model's predictions were visualized using data plots and graphs.
